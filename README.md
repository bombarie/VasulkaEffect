# VasulkaEffect
Real-time recreation of the title image of the documentary The Vasulka Effect using Unity.

Recently watched this wonderful documentary about the wonderful couple Steina and Woody Vasulka. I must admit that I didn't know about them before and their story, as well as their personality, was such a revelation to learn about. 

The documentary greatly inspires me to MAKE and as a tribute to that sentiment but also to them, I'm attempting to recreate the title image of the documentary in creative coding style. Of course this is a digital attempt and will probably not do the analog original's nature justice but hey, let's see how far I get.
